My name's Erika.  I believe the seeds of a good life are sustained and nurtured by daily learning. I have an associate degree in English (2011), 90% of an abandoned bachelor's degree in Psychology (2014), and am chipping away at my 2nd associate degree in Computer Programming. I'm a Rubyist at heart, but am always learning more JavaScript, HTML, CSS, SQL, C#, ASPX, and Dart. I am happily employed on a team of developers at a global manufacturing firm specializing in home furniture and automotive parts. 

 

When I'm not working, you can find me songwriting, cooking, reading, gaming, coding, and generally haunting my historic Midwestern apartment where I work and live. I share this space with a loving partner and our goofy cat, both of whom keep my soft skills sharp. I'm interested in UX/UI, generative AI and text completion, and game design. If you'd like to learn more, or are interested in collaborating, please reach out!
