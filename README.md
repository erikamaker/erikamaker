My name's Erika.  I believe the seeds of a good life are sustained and nurtured by daily learning. I have an associate degree in English (2011), 90% of an abandoned bachelor's degree in Psychology (2014), and am chipping away at my 2nd associate degree in Computer Programming. I'm a Rubyist at heart, but am always learning more JavaScript, HTML, CSS, ASP.NET, SQL, and C#. I am happily employed in my new role on a team of developers at Leggett & Platt (August, 2023)!

When I'm not working, you can find me songwriting, cooking, reading, gaming, coding (see my 'davinci-bot' and 'bonecrawl' repos), and generally haunting my historic Midwestern apartment where I work and live. I share this space with a loving partner and our goofy cat, both of whom keep my soft skills sharp. I'm interested in UX/UI, generative AI and text completion, and game design. If you'd like to learn more, or are interested in collaborating, please reach out!
