# Greetings and Salutations! ✨

Hi, there! My name's Erika.  I believe the seeds of a good life are self-sustained and nurtured by daily learning. I have an associate's degree in English (2011), 90% of an abandoned bachelor's in Psychology (2014), and am currently working on my 2nd associate's degree in Computer Programming. Between semesters, I'm also completing the Odin Project fullstack developer path. I'm a Rubyist at heart, and am also comfortable working in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

I care about UX / UI, and language processing (especially in the field of artificial intelligence and text completion). Currently, I'm polishing my chatbot 'Davinci-Bot', and working on my roguelite text adventure engine 'Bone Crawl'. When I'm not working on projects, you can find me songwriting, cooking, reading, gaming, or generally haunting my historic Midwestern apartment where I work and live. I have a loving partner and a goofy cat named Gish to keep my soft skills sharp. 

If you'd like to learn more, or are interested in collaborating, please reach out!
