Hi, there! My name's Erika.  I believe the seeds of a good life are self-sustained and nurtured by daily learning. I have an associate degree in English (2011), 90% of an abandoned bachelor's degree in Psychology (2014), and am currently working on my 2nd associate degree in Computer Programming. Between semesters, I'm also completing the Odin Project fullstack developer path. I'm a Rubyist at heart, and am also comfortable working in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

I care about UX / UI, and language processing (especially AI text completion). Right now, I'm polishing my chatbot 'David' (see my `davinci-bot` repo), and my roguelite text adventure engine 'Bone Crawl' (see my `bone-crawl` repo). When I'm not working on projects, you can find me songwriting, cooking, reading, gaming, or generally haunting my historic Midwestern apartment where I work and live. I share this space with a loving partner and our goofy cat, both of whom keep my soft skills sharp. 

If you'd like to learn more, or are interested in collaborating, please reach out!
