# Salutations! ‚≠ê

I write and maintain .NET and backend solutions for a global manufacturing firm specializing in home furniture and automotive parts. When I'm not working, you can find me songwriting, cooking, reading, gaming, coding (I'm a Rubyist at heart), and generally haunting my historic Midwestern apartment. I live with a loving partner and goofy cat, who both keep my soft skills sharp. I'm enthusiastic about UX/UI, generative AI, and game design. 

If you'd like to learn more, or are interested in collaborating, please reach out!
